# Formula-1-Monaco-Grand-Prix-Analysis
To analyze Formula 1 race data from the Monaco Grand Prix (2022â€“2024) using Python and the fastf1 library. The project focused on extracting actionable insights such as fastest lap times, average race pace, and driver-specific performance metrics. The goal was to demonstrate data manipulation, visualization, and domain-specific analytical skills.

## Features
- **Fastest Lap Analysis**: Identify drivers with the fastest single lap times each year.
- **Average Race Pace**: Calculate consistent lap times (excluding pit stops) for drivers.
- **Driver Comparison**: Track performance trends for Verstappen, Norris, and Leclerc.
- **Visualizations**: Generate plots to compare lap times and year-over-year performance.

  ## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- FastF1 (F1 data API)

  ## Dataset
- **Source**: Official F1 timing data via `fastf1` (cached locally for efficiency).
- **Years**: 2022, 2023, 2024.
- **Tracks**: Monaco Circuit.

  ## Setup
1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn fastf1
   import fastf1
   fastf1.Cache.enable_cache('path/to/cache/directory')

## Code Structure
- **Data Fetching**: Load race sessions and cache data.
- **Fastest Lap Extraction**: Use laps.pick_fastest() to identify top laps.
- **Average Pace Calculation**: Filter out pit laps and compute mean lap times.
- **Driver Analysis**: Compare Verstappen, Norris, and Leclerc using grouped data.
- **Visualization**: Plot trends in lap times and performance metrics.
